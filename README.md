# META STOCK ANALYST

**META STOCK ANALYST** is a final project of Business Data Analyst focused on analyzing the stock data of **Meta Platforms Inc. (META)** and building machine learning and dee learning models to predict future stock prices.
------------------

# Project Goal
The primary objective of the META STOCK ANALYST project is to harness data-driven methodologies to forecast future stock prices of Meta Platforms Inc. (META). This will be achieved through a comprehensive workflow that includes:

- Data Acquisition & Processing
Collecting and preprocessing historical and real-time financial data from reputable sources such as Yahoo Finance, Investor.com, and other financial APIs.

- Insight Discovery via Statistical Analysis
Applying descriptive statistics and regression techniques to uncover meaningful insights hidden within the data—such as value distributions, correlations between financial indicators, emerging trends, and recurring patterns.

- Predictive Modeling
Designing and training a set of machine learning and deep learning models—including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM—to forecast the stock price movements of META with a focus on accuracy and reliability.


# Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python and R
- **Data Handling** : Pandas, Numpy
- **Visualization** : Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **ML/DL Frameworks** : Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance, Investor.com

# Project Workflow
